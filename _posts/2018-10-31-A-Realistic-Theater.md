Terence's plays are not only meant to make the audience laugh, but also to make the audience think about what's happening in the play compared to their lifes.
The setting of the plays never contained something that the audience couldn't understand and it was often a neutral environment without the contamination of any culture.
Since the author wanted his plays to be more realistic he tried to avoid as much as possible any singing in the plays and he tried to modify the characters habbits, removing
the stereotypes.
Since he removed the stereotypes he focused the attention on the complexity of the true human relationships, such as the family life. A crucial point of Terence's plays is the psycological analisis of
the characters.
