(Cartagine in Italian) around the 185 b.C. In the same period the playright Plautus (Plauto in Italian) deceased, so it is said that the birthday of Terence has been set on this period to create a succession line among the comic poets.
When Terence first came to Rome, he was a slave of the senator Terenzio Lucano. Terenzio Lucano was surprised by the genius and the beuty of the young Terence and he quickly decided to make him a free man.
Thanks to the political power of his protector, Terence soon met the aristocratic environment in Rome and he was accused to be acting as a dummy for his protector; in fact Catone the old though that the actual
authors of Terence's plays was his protector.
After travelling to Greece for learning purposes he died in 159 b.C.

 * Andria
 * Hecyra
 * Heautontimorumenos
 * Eunuchus
